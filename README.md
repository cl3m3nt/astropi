# Astropi
This repository hosts the experiment of the Bergson Highschool team for the 2020-2021 Astro Pi challenge.
The Bergson team is working on building a Deep Learning predictive model, predicting the atmosphere NO2 level from NDVI images.
NDVI images are taken from the NoIR pi camera, while the predictive model use Convolutional Neural Network to predict NO2 pollution.
